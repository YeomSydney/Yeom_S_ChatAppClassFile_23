## How to install npx, express

### Steps
Go to Express Generator (https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html)

* Do not include double quotes

Type “npm install -g express-generator” in your Terminal/GitBash

* Flag -g means “Global”
* If not working, type “sudo npm install -g express-generator” instead.

Type “npx express (Folder Name - Just name it newly) -v hbs”

* Flag -v means “Vue Engine”
* -v hbs means “I’m changing vue engine to hbs” 
* When implementing that line, it would show the steps you have to follow
* Then, to address all the issues, run this line too: “npm audit fix --force” You want to see “found 0 vulnerabilities” at the end of the code
* echo “node_modules” > .gitignore

### Vue & Hbs

*** Vue - Customer side

*** Hbs - Server side (Like PHP)
